     <p id = "text">World of Warships is a free-to-play naval action-themed massively multiplayer online game produced by international game developer and publisher Wargaming.
       The game features aspects similar to World of Tanks and World of Warplanes, having several classes of warships fulfilling different roles within teamed player versus player battles.
        It was released for Microsoft Windows on September 17, 2015.</p>

        <p id = "text2">On August 16, 2011, the company website of Wargaming.net, developer and publisher of World of Tanks and World of Warplanes, announced World of Battleships, a free-to-play naval action MMO, intended to complete the World of war trilogy developed by the company.[7] On August 2, 2012, the game was renamed World of Warships.[8] On November 14, 2013, the game entered closed alpha testing.[9]

During Tokyo Gameshow 2014, Wargaming CEO Victor Kislyi announced a collaboration between World of Warships and the Arpeggio of Blue Steel anime.[10] The collaboration involves allowing players to unlock ships of the Fog Fleet from the anime, and doing special missions involving them. Another collaboration with Haifuri was later announced in September 2016.[11]

Closed beta testing for World of Warships started on March 12, 2015, shortly after closed alpha ended, with the non-disclosure agreement covering the alpha being lifted at the same time.[12] On April 9, 2015, pre-order packages consisting of premium warships and access to the closed beta test became available for purchase by players.[13]

Open beta testing for World of Warships started on July 2, 2015, as the final step prior to the game's formal launch.[14] During a Famitsu interview with global director Ivan Moroz, it was revealed that as of the open beta test, approximately 85% of the core game development was complete, and that there were future plans to introduce weather effects and night battle after the game's official release.[15]

On September 3, 2015, Wargaming announced that the game had exited open beta. The game was officially launched on September 17, 2015 for Microsoft Windows.[16]

Out of all of the game servers, the Chinese server has the highest player population, with a peak value of 120,000 concurrent players online as of December 2015; because of this, there are plans to eventually implement multi-cluster servers there.[1]
